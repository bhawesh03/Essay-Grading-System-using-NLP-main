# Essay-Grading-System-using-NLP

This is an automatic essay grading system based on given questions. A dataset of essays written by high school students on various types of exam questions were considered. All of them were graded by the instructors and have been used to evaluate the essays written. In order to find a relationship in between scores and texts, various features have been used. We use those features along with the scores to form both a regression and a classification model. When we evaluate them, we see that we can predict the scores with within an acceptable range.
